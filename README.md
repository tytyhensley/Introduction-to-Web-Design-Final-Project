# Introduction-to-Web-Design-Final-Project

These are the final webpages coded and designed for my final project in Intro to Web Design that was taken in the fall of 2019. 

A suite of predominantly HTML5 and CSS webpages that will act as a prototype for a resume website for myself. They include pages about myslef, what I do and how to get in contact with me. They've exercised what we've learnt throughout the semester in HTML, CSS and Javascript. All webpages are completely responsive.

All webpages and assets are hosted on glitch.com, and you can check out the website itself on http://tyeecehensley.glitch.me/
